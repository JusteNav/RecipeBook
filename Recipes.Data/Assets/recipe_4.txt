INGREDIENTS
2,5 cups (250g) of pasta (we used conchiglie)
1 tablespoons oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
2 cups (300g) of ham, cut into chunks (get a nice thick slice from the deli counter)
2,5 cups of sweet cream
1 tablespoons English mustard
11‚ÅÑ4 cup of mature cheddar, grated
(veggies...whatever you want)

INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1  Bring a large pan of water to the boil and cook the pasta following pack instructions, if you want to add veggies cook them to the pan for the final 4 mins. Drain and set aside.
Step 2  Bring a large pan of water to the boil and cook the pasta following pack instructions, adding the broccoli florets to the pan for the final 4 mins. Drain and set aside.
Step 3  Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion for 5 mins to soften, then stir in the garlic and cook for 1 min more. Stir in the ham, cream and mustard, then bring to the boil. Add the pasta and veggies, then stir in the cheese, coating everything in the sauce.
