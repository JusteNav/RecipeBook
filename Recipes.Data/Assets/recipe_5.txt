Chocolate Chip Muffins

INGREDIENTS
¾ cup milk
⅓ cup vegetable oil
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
½ cup white sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
¾ cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips or semi-sweet chocolate, grated
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons brown sugar

INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1  Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
Step 2  Combine milk, oil, and egg in a small bowl until well blended. Combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl, making a well in the center. Pour milk mixture into well and stir until batter is just combined; fold in chocolate chips or grated chocolate.
Step 3  Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Mix 3 tablespoons white sugar and brown sugar together in a small bowl; sprinkle on tops of muffins.
Step 4  Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or cool completely.
