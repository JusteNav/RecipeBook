Tortilla Pizza

INGREDIENTS
Tortillas
1⁄4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

toppings (salami, ham, cheese, olives, veggies...whatever you want and have on hand!)

INSTRUCTIONS

Step 2  Take a fork and poke holes throughout tortilla. This will allow it to be more crispy without burning or becoming soggy in the middle.
Step 3  Take tomato sauce and spread all over.
Step 4  Sprinkle cheese as desired. (About ¼ cup)
Step 5  Add your favorite toppings.
Step 6  Cook in oven or toaster oven for about 10 minutes. (Until cheese is fully melted and edges look crispy).
