Thin Pancakes

INGREDIENTS
1 cups flour
2 eggs
11‚ÅÑ4  cups milk
1 teaspoon sugar
Pinch salt (tip of a teaspoon)
Oil for frying

INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1 Sift the flour, sugar and salt, make a well in it.
Step 2 Crack in the eggs, add a bit of the milk.
Step 3 Then start whisking it all together (you can use a mixer).
Step 4 Next, whisk in the rest of the milk and until you have a pancake batter that resembles the consistency of whipping cream.

NOTES
Make sure your pan is evenly nice and hot before you start cooking the pancakes. If the pan isn't hot enough, the recipe won't work. Add on a bit of oil, and quickly swirl it around the pan. Then pour on the pancake batter and quickly swirl it around. 
I always pour on the pancake batter using a measuring cup, so I end up with consistently-sized pancakes.Serve with jam, sour cream, ice cream with berries and fruits - whatever you want!
